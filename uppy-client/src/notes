Resuming file upload notes:

* Uppy uses a protocol called TUS to achieve resumable uploads. This requires
  the back-end to implement middleware to parse and store data that comes
  through this protocol.
* Unfortunately, Uppy themselves have stated that their Node middleware is not
  being properly maintained, having outdated dependencies and untested code.
  Information can be found here: https://github.com/tus/tus-node-server
* Their recommendation is to use a Go implementation called tusd. That repo can
  be found here: https://github.com/tus/tusd
* Found another implementation called resumable.js, but the package has not been
  published in four years.
* Found an implementation here that seems to do what we require but it might not
  be easy to integrate with GoldenRetriever.
